Production monitoring: drift and fairness, computed from live traffic.

The problem this module exists to solve
---------------------------------------
You cannot monitor accuracy in production. Whether an applicant defaults is
known next month at the earliest, and for a rejected applicant it is never
known at all. By the time the accuracy number arrives, the model has been
wrong for weeks.

So production monitoring for ML is the practice of watching PROXIES that move
before the accuracy does:

    input drift     the applicants arriving no longer look like the ones the
                    model was fitted on
    output drift    the distribution of scores has shifted
    decision mix    more applications are being sent to manual review
    fairness gap    one group is being flagged at a different rate than before

None of these prove the model is wrong. Each of them is a reason to look.

Why PSI
-------
Population Stability Index is the standard drift measure in consumer credit,
which is where this problem comes from. For a feature binned into k buckets,
with expected proportion e_i from the reference and actual proportion a_i from
the live window.

The conventional reading, and the one the alerts use:

    PSI < 0.10          no meaningful shift
    0.10 <= PSI < 0.25  moderate shift, worth investigating
    PSI >= 0.25         significant shift, act

It is symmetric, bounded below at zero, and cheap enough to recompute on every
request. Its weakness is that it is univariate: it cannot see a shift in the
RELATIONSHIP between two features, only in each one separately.
