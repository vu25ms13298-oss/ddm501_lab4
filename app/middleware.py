        Four things this must get right, each of which is a real outage
        someone has had:

          1. Skip the paths in EXCLUDED. Prometheus scrapes /metrics every
             ten seconds; counting those dominates the traffic panel on a
             quiet service.
          2. Label with the ROUTE TEMPLATE, not the resolved path — use the
             _route_template helper below. Without it, an endpoint like
             /applications/{id} mints one time series per id, and the
             cardinality explosion takes Prometheus down with it.
          3. Record in a `finally` block, so a request that raises on the way
             through is still counted. Middleware that only records on
             success reports a perfectly healthy service during an outage.
          4. Keep REQUESTS_IN_PROGRESS balanced: inc before, dec in the
             `finally`. An unbalanced gauge drifts upward forever.
